## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CESNET/NEMEA/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CESNET/NEMEA/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* For patches in the C language, check if the patch meets the [coding style](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Framework/blob/master/libtrap/CodingStyle.md).

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [NEMEA mailing list](https://random.cesnet.cz/mailman/listinfo/nemea) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use NEMEA or its parts in the [NEMEA mailing list](https://random.cesnet.cz/mailman/listinfo/nemea).
