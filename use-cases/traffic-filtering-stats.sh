This script expects one or more NFDUMP files.  It replays the flows
and sends them into unirecfilter.  Unirecfilter has 4 output IFCs
that are connected with 4 flowcounters.

As a result, 4 statistics are computed:
  # of flows with src or dst port 25
  # of flows with src or dst port 80
  # of flows with src or dst port 22
  # of flows that don'ลง have ports 22, 25, or 80
These numbers are summed.
